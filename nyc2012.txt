"1. Totals are not available for these results due to suppression constraints. More Information:"

Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' is displayed for data values when they must not be provided in order to protect personal privacy. Data is"
"suppressed if fewer than 16 cases are reported in any one line of the results table. Data for the ""Asian / Pacific Islander"","
"""American Indian or Alaska Native"", and the ""Other Races Combined"" race categories are suppressed at the Metropolitan"
"Statistical Area level for populations less than 50,000 persons. Data are suppressed at the state level for certain race and"
"ethnicity groups: 1) American Indian or Alaska Native data are suppressed at the state level for Delaware, Illinois, Kansas,"
"Kentucky, New Jersey, and New York; 2) Asian or Pacific Islander data are suppressed at the state level for Delaware, Kansas,"
"and Kentucky; 3) Hispanic data are supressed at the state level for Delaware, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2015.html#Confidentiality."
"2. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for all data values when sex-specific cancers are combined with the wrong sex. More"
"information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2015.html#Genital Cancers List."
"3. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"4. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria. Incidence data"
"shown for the United States are diagnoses and populations from included registries only."
"5. Information on primary site, behavior, and histology was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for"
"Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) and categorized according to the revised SEER recodes dated January 27, 2003, which define"
"standard groupings of primary cancer sites."
"6. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and"
"Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for"
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national"
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005."
